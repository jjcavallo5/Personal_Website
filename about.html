                <h2>Academic Life</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently attending Wayne State university and persuing a Bachelors degree
                    in both Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I plan to continue my
                    education by getting a Masters degree in one or both of these disciplines.
                    Despite the large work-load, I have managed to maintain a 3.95 GPA throughout my
                    two years in college. I have taken courses that relate to the design and
                    analysis of algorithms, Computer architecture, basic programming concepts, and
                    ethics in computer science. I have also taken Biomedical Engineering design
                    labs, in which we learned and applied the engineering design process, as well as
                    classes on Computer-Aided Design and 3D modeling.

                            Going into my freshman year of college, I worked as a daycamp counselor
                            where I oversaw a group of 8-10 kids in grades K-2. I was in charge of
                            leading games and activities for the kids and had to come up with
                            creative ways to keep them entertained for the entire day.

                            During my sophomore year, I struggled to find work due to the pandemic.
                            I decided to do programming freelance work through Fiverr.com. While on
                            the site, I sharpened my C and C++ coding skills by writing efficient
                            code for my customers within the given deadline. I also learned skills
                            relating to dealing with online customers and setting my own prices for
                            specific projects based on estimated workload.

                        has not only taught me how to manage my time, but it has provided
                        experiences in leadership and teamwork.

                            Wayne State, the athletic department encourages their athletes to
                            volunteer regularly. I have had the opportunity to volunteer at the
                            following events:

                            I recieved the Captains award for Clarkston Cross Country during my
                            senior season, and was elected as a captain during both my Junior and
                            Senior seasons. This meant that I was the main source of communication
                            between the coach and the rest of the team, and I was expected to
                            inspire the younger athletes and ensure they enjoyed the sport.
