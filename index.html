                            group of 8-10 children, grades kindergarten through second, and was in
                            charge of leading some games for a larger group of 40-50 children. I was
                            also involved with the township parks and recreation department, meaning
                            I was expected to work events put on for the community.

                            During the Covid pandemic, I struggled to find my first internship.
                            Therefore, I decided to work on my programming skills by freelancing. I
                            created an account on Fiverr.com and advertised my skills. I received
                            quite a few clients and completed projects for them, most of which used
                            C and C++. This taught me how to complete projects efficiently and
                            produce high quality work.
